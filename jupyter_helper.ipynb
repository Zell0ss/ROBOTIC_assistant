We are responsible of the creation and maintennance of BNP's private cloud via DPI wich is its action broker and library of products and Vanish wich is our orchestator. We are also the responsible team of creating and maintaining the onboarding automations for some entitlements of MyIAM. I would provide you some information and then I will ask you to answer some emails I will provide.\\n\\n## 1. Entitlements automatic onboarding\\nOur team is known in MyIAM as IV2 Manual Provisioner. Despite the unfortunate name we have in MyIAM, ROBOTIC is responsible of maintaining the automatic onboarding flows for IV2 and we are not allowed nor we have rights to onboard anything manually. We do not outsource our automatic flows to onboard anything else. All our onboarding is done automatically and is triggered either by MyIAM to provision an entitlement managed by us or by ecosystem and subscription deployments.\\nFor IV2 extended rights team defined a complete microjurisdiction (for more detail you can check it here https://collab.cib.echonet/iandp/sites/Risk-and-Strategy/IT%20Security%20Operations/SecProd-OS-and-Services/UserGuides/SitePages/Home.aspx ).\\nDue to that we are limited in what our flows are allowed and what we technically can do.\\nUsers can request entitlements for them or for service users through MyIAM. The entitlements that we onboard can be divided in three:\",\n",

The SVC and GEN accounts for managing the ecosystem and its subscriptions are already onboarded when said ecosystem/subscription is created\\n- We also cannot onboard the Breakglass entitlement to an user that already has the User one.\\nFor checking ELDAP groups of an user you can use their own web site https://eldaptool.cib.echonet/ldapTools/',\n",

We will locate automatically said account and onboard it\\nFor Active Directory we can also onboard SVC accounts (on DEV, STG, PRD).\\nAlso, in case of SVC accounts, they should be IV2 accounts and from the same AD root as, unlike the users, they are not syndicated between AD. So, for example, in case of CN=IV2AMER_ADM_UNIX_ROBOTIC-TOOLS_ADMIN_DEV,OU=Tardis,OU=IV2,DC=amer,DC=net,DC=intra we are only allowed to onboard service users from DC=amer, DC=net, DC=intra\\nFor AD entitlements we cannot onboard uids instead tec accounts.

The PO serves as the main point of contact for the development team, stakeholders, and customers, and is responsible for making decisions about the product roadmap and feature prioritization. The PO should have a deep understanding of the product he aims to build and its technical capabilities, customer needs, and user experience. The PO is responsible for defining product requirements in and for working with his development team to ensure that those requirements are implemented. He should also take point in any incident investigation regarding its product.',\n",

The PO can also define management actions that can be taken on their products, such as restarting a server or performing a backup/restore.\\nAll these flows are owned and designed by the PO, although they may call subflows from other teams to perform common tasks.
